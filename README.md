## Environments

This repo is tested on following environment:

* Windows 10
* Python >= 3.7 # 3.10.11 works for this run
* PyTorch == 2.3.1
* Cuda V12.3.52

## Install

1. Follow [`LAFAN1`](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset) dataset's installation guide.
   *You need to install git lfs first before cloning the dataset repo.*

2. Run LAFAN1's `evaluate.py` to unzip and validate it. (Install `numpy` first if you don't have it)
   ```bash
   $ pip install numpy
   $ python ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset/evaluate.py 
   ```
   With this, you will have unpacked LAFAN dataset under `ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset` folder.

3. Install appropriate `pytorch` version depending on your device (CPU/GPU),
   then install packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Trained Weights

You can download trained weights from [here](https://works.do/FCqKVjy).

## Train from Scratch

Training script is `trainer.py`. For convenience, `train.sh` has the following
arguments populated by default, so you can make changes there.

```bash
python trainer.py \
	--processed_data_dir="processed_data_80/" \
	--window=90 \
	--batch_size=32 \
	--epochs=5000 \
	--device=0 \
	--entity=cmib_exp \
	--exp_name="cmib_80" \
	--save_interval=50 \
	--learning_rate=0.0001 \
	--loss_cond_weight=1.5 \
	--loss_pos_weight=0.05 \
	--loss_rot_weight=2.0 \
	--from_idx=9 \
	--target_idx=88 \
	--interpolation='slerp'

```

## Inference

You can use `run_cmib.py` for inference. Please refer to help page of `run_cmib.py` for more details.

```python
python run_cmib.py --help
```

abstract = {Motion in-betweening (MIB) is a process of generating intermediate
skeletal movement between the given start and target poses while preserving the
naturalness of the motion, such as periodic footstep motion while walking.
Although state-of-the-art MIB methods are capable of producing plausible motions
given sparse key-poses, they often lack the controllability to generate motions
satisfying the semantic contexts required in practical applications. We focus on
the method that can handle pose or semantic conditioned MIB tasks using a
unified model. We also present a motion augmentation method to improve the
quality of pose-conditioned motion generation via defining a distribution over
smooth trajectories. Our proposed method outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art MIB method in pose prediction errors while providing additional
controllability. Our code and results are available on our project web page:
